## Abstract
High-dimensional sequenced data often appears in practice. State-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) models suffer prediction accuracy problem from complex relations amongst values of attributes. Adopting unsupervised clustering that categorize data based on their attribute similarity, results in data of lower dimensions that can be structured in a hierarchical fashion. It is essential to consider these data relations to improve model training performance. In this study, we propose a new approach to synthesize and predict sequences of hierarchical data.

### Prospects
* Demand forecasting for supply chain management
* Predict final grades base on students' current learning situation
* Use credit ratings to predict whether customers will bounce

### Contributions
* Input generation: provide more data to train a  model such as RNN
* Sequence prediction: achieve higher accuracy for predicting high dimensional data sequence

<!--- The insertion of these two parts doesn't make sense now, the whole 'Abstract' paragraph would need a thorough overhaul --->
<!--- There should be a distinct indication between these two parts --->

## Methodology
Our mainframe consists of three parts, as shown in Fig. 1. The first part is Phase Space Partition. We use GHSOM  as the means of partition sample space in an unsupervised fashion. We adopt HiSeqGAN  for symbolic labeling and sequence synthesis, where we use two methods to calculate the symbol distance, the first one uses coordinates and cosine similarity. The second one uses the HiSeqGAN to synthesize discrete sequences. Finally,the last part of the prediction is based on a large set of synthesized sequences. Given partial information (a prefiex), we look for sequences that match the
prefiex and use their suffix to predict the future states of the given information.

### GHSOM & Hierarchical Data Encoding
GHSOM is a self-organizing map that grows hierarchically based on data distribution. The GHSOM map results in data in clusters of a tree-like structure(Figure 2). Use decimal encoding to label those partitions(Figure 3). After using the decimal number to label partitions, we converse each number to the two-dimensional coordinate vector(Figure 4).Two-dimensional coordinate vector is used to Label error which is defined as the ladder distance of two partitions  and the distance between the two partitions in the smallest common  ancestor partition.We need to  cuculate the cosine similarity of the two coordination for Label error.

### HiSeqGAN
HiSeqGAN uses the real-world data and the native samples generated by the generator to train the discriminator so that the discriminator can distinguish real-world data from fake samples. Then, the reward is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps by using the Monte Carlo search. Second, the generator updates by reinforcement learning.

### Sequence Similarity
To evaluate the prediction on clusters between two labels, we propose three-dimensional cosine similarity on their coordinates. The reason that we extend two-dimensional to three-dimensional is to prevent the distortion of the original point on the same plane.

## Step 1 : GHSOM Clustering
<!-- Figures that needs editing: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 -->
<!-- Document structure should be reconsidered -->
The objective of this step is to prepare the data by ***abstracting high dimensional data with symbolic labels using unsupervised clustering GHSOM***. Execute the following command to transform data from high-dimensional to a hierarchical form. Each cluster would be labeled according to its position in each layer. Then generate cluster sequence base on `index` and `date_column`. The link to our example data is [wm5-normalize.csv](./raw-data/wm5-normalize.csv).
<!-- "position in each layer"? -->

```
python execute-ghsom.py --tau1=0.1 --tau2=0.01 --data=wm5-normalize --index=id --target=id --date_column=week --train_column=TA_video,TA_text,Teacher_video,Teacher_text
```

* *tau1* : the same-layer SOM map similarity.
* *tau2* : the depth of the GHSOM structure.
* *data* : to set the data name which map the ***.csv*** file in raw-data folder.
* *index* : to set the field as the index for clustering.
* *target* : to set the field as the index for clustering.
* *date_column* : Fields sorted by time, which use this column to generate a cluster sequence.
* *train_column* : Field to be clustering.
<!--- What does the last two attributes mean exactly? --->

### Section 1-A: Construct The Abstract Domain - Clusters
<!--<center><img src='./image/hipic1.png' width='700px'></center>-->
<center><img src='./image/Ustep1-1.png' width='800px'></center>
In the first section, we use GHSOM for clustering based on attribute similarity. After the data has been prepared following the instructions above, you will generate data in the  `applications/$data/`  folder. (ex.applications/wm5_normalize) Here we use the [GHSOM](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/ghsom/) program developed by Vienna University of Technology.
<!--- "you will generate data..." means we're to use the generated data located in that folder? --->

1. Before converting high-dimensional data into hierarchical data, we would convert the data into a specific format first(.in file and .prop file).

  * The .in file format is as follows (create_ghsom_input_file) [wm5-normalize_ghsom.in](./applications/wm5-normalize/GHSOM/data/wm5-normalize_ghsom.in) 
    
  > Reference from : http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/somlib/download/SOMLib_Datafiles.html#input_vectors

  * Then GHSOM property file is generated as follows (create_ghsom_prop_file) [wm5-normalize_ghsom.prop](./applications/wm5-normalize/GHSOM/wm5-normalize_ghsom.prop) 
   
  > Reference from : http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dm/somtoolbox/examples/PROPERTIES

2. In the second part, we will start to run GHSOM. First, GHSOM would generate a cluster for each week for each student id (extract_ghsom_output) and then make a cluster with a label (save_ghsom_cluster_label)([wm5-normalize_with_clustered_label.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/wm5-normalize_with_clustered_label.csv)). 

3. After making each cluster with a label, we need to generate a cluster a coordinate representation intends to calculate the loss function(save_ghsom_with_coordinnate_representation_label).
 
When GHSOM finished clustering, it will generate the output in `applications/$data/GHSOM/output/$data` folder. It contains  `.html`, `.map`, `.unit`, `.wgt`. The `.unit` file describes the units of the trained Self-Organizing Map. It is written by the SOM training program. The files consist of two blocks, the first one describing the general SOM structure, the second giving a specific description of every unit. The first 3 parameter entries are given as a sanity check to find out whether the given SOM map file and weight vector file match. If any of the 3 first parameters does not match the program should print a detailed error message and exit.

### Section 1-B: Relabel With Symbolic Labels
<!---<center><img src='./image/hipic2.png' width='700px'></center>--->

4. In the fourth part, we want to have Integer labels but the label we generate in the second part is Float labels. Therefore, we use "format_rnn_input_integer" function to format our labels ([wm5-normalize_with_clustered_label_integer.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/wm5-normalize_with_clustered_label_integer.csv))(This data for next step [rnn_input_data_integer.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_data_integer.csv))and use "format_rnn_input_float" to create "item-seq.csv" data ([wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv](./raw-data/wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv))which is needed in the next part.
<!---
第二部分開始執行ghsom，會先產生ghsom分群(ex.extract_ghsom_output的圖)，接著希望每個分群加上標籤，
而產生了with_cluster_label.csv這個檔案。
--->

<!--<center><img src='./image/hipic3.png' width='700px'></center>-->
<!--After making each cluster with a label, we need to generate a cluster a coordinate representation intends to calculate the loss function.-->
<!---
分完群也上過標籤後，第三部分再給予每個分群座標位置，最終每筆資料將產生屬於自己的xy座標(相同座標代表相同集群)
，目的是為了之後算loss function。

<!-- The editable file of hipic4 is lost, it has to be reconstructed -->
<!--In the fourth part, we want to have  Integer labels but the label we generate in the second part is  Float labels. Therefore , we use ''format_rnn_input_integer'' this function to format our labels and use "format_rnn_input_float"create "item-seq.csv" data which is needed in the next part.-->
<!---
最後第四階段剛開始使用第二階段產生的with_cluster_label.csv，因為原本此檔案的標籤是浮點數形式，
但我們希望其表現方式為整數，因此透過format_rnn_input_integer這個方法轉換成我想要看到的整數標籤而得到了
rnn_input_data_integer.csv這個檔案。另外產生item-seq.csv是為了接下來的第五部分需要把每位id分群成一個標籤而準備的資料。
--->

### Section 1-C: Label Generating
Here, we generate a symbolic label for each student that represents their weekly records over the semester. Given the GHSOM map, each weekly data can then be represented as a label that encodes their cluster. We can then generate for each student a cluster sequence that represents their weekly records over the semester. The cluster sequence is based on the fields given by `$index` and `$date_column`.([wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv](./raw-data/wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv))

<!--
```csv
id,week1,week2,week3,week4,week5,week6,week7,week8,week9,week10,week11,week12,week13,week14,week15,week16,week17,week18
102205089,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5524,5521,5521,5521,5521,5521,5560
```
-->

```bash
python ghsom-item-seq.py --data=wm5-normalize --index=id --train_column=week1,week2,week3,week4,week5,week6,week7,week8,week9,week10,week11,week12,week13,week14,week15,week16,week17,week18
```

* *data* : Set the data name which map the ***.csv*** file in raw-data folder.
* *index* : Set the field as the index for clustering.
* *train_column* : Field to be clustering.

<center><img src='./image/Ustep1-3.png' width='800px'></center>
<!-- The editable files of 'seq' are lost, it has to be reconstructed -->

5. Because our raw data have a lot of weekly columns we use GHSOM to reduct weekly columns' dimensions to the label([rnn_input_data_integer.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_data_integer.csv)). However, our goal is "each student " has a cluster label. Thus, we need to achieve this goal. 
   First, we create a new folder to store our data for step2 and then read [wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv](./raw-data/wm5-normalize-item-seq.csv) to generate [wm5-normalize-item-seq_ghsom.in](./applications/wm5-normalize/GHSOM/data/wm5-normalize-item-seq_ghsom.in) and [wm5-normalize-item-seq_ghsom.prop](./applications/wm5-normalize/GHSOM/wm5-normalize-item-seq_ghsom.prop). 
6. In the second part(ghsom_clustering), it also starts to generate GHSOM clusters (extract_ghsom_output),and give each student a cluster label ([rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv)). 
7. In the last part, we want to have Integer labels but the label we generate in the second part is Float labels. Therefore, we use "format_rnn_input_integer" function to format our labels ([rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv)).

<!---
因為原始資料欄位多，前面的ghsom是先把多維資料降維成一個標籤，得到了「每個id的每週資料皆有一個標籤代表其資料屬性(rnn_input_data_integer.csv)」
然而最終目的是希望將「每個id的全部資料」降維成一個標籤，因此第五部分再次將「每個id的每週資料皆有一個標籤代表其資料屬性」的資料用ghsom分群成「每個id皆有一個標籤」代表其整體屬性。
要使每個id皆有一個標籤的第一步，一樣是先建立資料夾，跟前面不同的是這邊讀取的是item-seq data，然後開始產生GHSOM的input file和prop file。
--->


<!--In the second part, it also starts to generate GHSOM clusters(ex.extract_ghsom_output),and give each student a cluster label (ex. rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv).-->
<!---
第二部分開始執行ghsom，一樣會先產生ghsom分群(ex.extract_ghsom_output的圖)，接著希望每個id擁有一個標籤，而產生了rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv這個檔案。
--->


<!--In the last part, we want to have Integer labels but the label we generate in the second part is Float labels. Therefore, we use ''format_rnn_input_integer'' this function to format our labels (rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv).-->
<!---
最後第三階段使用第二階段產生的rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv，因為原本此檔案的標籤是浮點數形式，但我們希望其表現方式為整數，
因此透過format_rnn_input_integer這個方法轉換成我想要看到的整數標籤而得到了rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv這個檔案。到這邊完成Step 1。
--->

## Step 2 : Sequence Synthesis
The objective of this step is to ***use HiSeqGAN to generate cluster sequence***. We use SeqGAN to generate data $Data_{HiSeqGAN}$ . There are 144 original data, so here we use SeqGAN to generate 856 time series data. Execute the following command to generate a sequence for sequence synthesis.

```bash
python execute-hiseqgan.py --data=wm5-normalize --target=id --generated_num=856 --total_batch=100 --batch_size=5 --seq_length=18
```

* *data* : Set the data name which map the ***.csv*** file in raw-data folder.
* *target* : Set the field as the index for clustering.
* *generated_num* : The number that how many sequences are generated.
* *total_batch* : Number of times the entire dataset was trained.
* *batch_size* : The batch size will determine the number of samples we train at a time.
* *seq_length* : The length size that how many time series columns in the data.

1. First, it would generate a log file, data settings, and create folders to store data generated by step2. Then read [rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster.csv) and generate a [seqGAN_input_data.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/seqGAN_input_data.txt) for executing HiSeqGAN.

2. Second, we will start to execute HiSeqGAN, the generator would generate a sequence similar to raw sequence data, and the discriminator will evaluate those sequences. If the sequence is not similar to raw sequences it will recreate a new one unstill the discriminator is satisfied.This step will read [seqGAN_input_data.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/seqGAN_input_data.txt) , [generator_sample.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/save/generator_sample.txt) and [experiment-log.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/save/experiment-log.txt).In the end it will create [seqGAN_output_data.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/seqGAN_output_data.txt)

3. Finally,because we want to combine raw sequence data and generated sequence data , read [rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_integer.csv) and [seqGAN_output_data.txt](./applications/wm5-normalize/SeqGAN/seqGAN_output_data.txt) and then create a new data  [rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_label_seqgan_train.csv](./applications/wm5-normalize/data/rnn_input_item_seq_with_cluster_label_seqgan_train.csv) which combines raw sequence and generated sequence.

<!---放一張input output結果圖--->


<!---
STEP2開始，首先先建立log紀錄文件和資料相關設定，還有一樣建立step2執行過程中存放資料的資料夾。接著讀取前面step1
最後產生的每個id有一個標籤的csv檔，產生segqan 需要的的input資料。
--->

<!---
第二部分開始執行seqgan，generator會先生出一組序列，讓已看過真實資料的discriminator評斷generator
產的資料的真假，如果看起來不真generator就需要重新產生序列，直到discriminator滿意為止。
我們的目標為將144筆的原始資料，希望產生856筆資料，使整體資料共有1000筆，將拿來用在之後第三階段使用rnn來評估產生的序列的品質。
