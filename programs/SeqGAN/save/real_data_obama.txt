Good afternoon Let begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti-war rally 
I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances
The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword 
the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil
